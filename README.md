Drew's portfolio site. Not to substitute as a Resume, though.


### To Do
- Make the one page per scroll functionality
- Prettify the timeline (align the right margin for the work descriptions)
- Margins in general need fixing
- Background on Personal Project Dropdown needs to be consistent with other dropdowns
- Add thank you and picture at the bottom
- Add a color schema to all clickable items
